Recipes project from TOP

This is the first project from TOP. At the moment, it's supposed to 
only contain Html. I don't expect to learn much about hmtl itself 
from this, as I already know the language. I still prefer to trust 
the process an not to skip steps. Also this will provide me a training
for the use of Git, which I clearly do not master yet.
